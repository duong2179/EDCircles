# EDCircles
[EDCircles: A real-time circle detector with a false detection control](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031320312004268)

### Disclaimer
I was given roughly one week to implement EDCircles from scratch... that seems to be impossible, for some reasons:
+ I have to go to work at daytime.
+ I am not experienced much with OpenCV as well as image processing.

However, I did **try my best** to study relevant knowledge (from **almost scratch**) and implement 'so-far' job as what I understand.
